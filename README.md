# Pillar Homelab Infrastructure

## Overview
I maintain a multi-server homelab environment designed for IT and cybersecurity learning and experimentation. The lab runs on Proxmox VE clustered across multiple servers and supports services including:

- Active Directory Domain Controller (AD-DC) for user and asset management
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
- DNS management
- Media hosting and Network Attached Storage (NAS)

This lab enables hands-on practice with network segmentation, user and device management, incident response simulations, and cybersecurity exercises.

## Technologies Used
- Proxmox VE (clustered)
- Windows Server (Active Directory)
- Linux (various distros)
- Endpoint Detection and Response tools
- DNS Servers
- NAS and media server tools

## Skills Applied
- Inventory Management
- Linux system administration
- PC building and hardware management
- Project management and continuous improvement
- Incident response and monitoring

## Project Goals
- Simulate real-world IT and security environments
- Practice offensive and defensive cybersecurity tactics
- Manage network infrastructure including VLANs and switches
- Document all configurations, setups, and lessons learned

## Setup & Configuration


## Future Work
- Automate more configurations with Ansible or scripts
- Expand monitoring with SIEM integration
- Perform regular security assessments and document findings
